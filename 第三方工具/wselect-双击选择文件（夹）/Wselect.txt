Wselect Ver. 1.31 (c) 2005-2006, Horst Schaeffer
------------------------------------------------

Wselect offers a window with a list of items for selection in a batch (BAT/CMD) process.
The items are read (line by line) from a file that can be generated in the batch process. 
The file may have any number of lines with anything you want to offer. 

User's selection by double click or Cursor up/down + Enter. Abort with Escape or by closing the window. 

Wselect returns the selected item text embedded in a given text string through the token "$item" (not case sensitive). This way you can produce messages or commands. For example, if the given text string is "SET MyVar=$item", the token $item will be replaced by the selected item.  
Wselect also returns the errorlevel (1..254) of the selected item. 

The output can be sent to a text file or to a batch file for subsequent execution. Use the redirection symbol ">" to overwrite or ">>" to append to the target file.

Syntax 
------
  Wselect ListFile ListHeader OutputString [options] [> OutputFile]

Parameters:
  ListFile      is the source file with the items (lines)
  ListHeader    will show in the title bar
  OutputString  will be sent to Standard Output (to be redirected to a file)
Options:
  /quote    produces double quote marks around the $item in the output string.
  /oemlist  means that the list must be translated to ANSI for proper display
  /oemout   translates the complete outputString to OEM format

Note: "OEM" is the character/code assignment used under DOS. It is different from Window's ANSI format only for non-standard characters (code above 127), like "הי"

Double quote marks are required for each of the three parameters if they contain any spaces or delimiters. All parameters and options must be separated by blank space (no commas!).

As a special feature (and in addition to the /quote option) Wselect will replace two single quote marks ('') with one double quote mark (") in the OutputString. 

Examples
--------
assuming there is Files.txt with a list of filenames (produced by a DIR command):

  Wselect Files.txt "Select a file" "XXedit $item" /oemlist /quote > %temp%\temp.bat
  call %temp%\temp.bat
  del %temp%\temp.bat

  Wselect Files.txt "Select a file" "XXedit ''%MyDir%\$item'' /P" /oemlist > temp.bat

You can also use "SET varname=$item" to produce an environmental variable, however the item text must not contain any symbols that may corrupt the temporary batch file. 

Errorlevels
-----------
    1..254  selected item number
    255     selected item number is 255 or higher 
    0       error (messagebox) or selection aborted
